# NBA Recap :basketball:

## Description
___


This web app was created as a part of exploring `Streamlit` as a method to deploy data projects. It is directed to people who, like me, love NBA basketball and want to recap the main events from seasons going back to 1980 - award winners, season leaders, shot charts for individual players and per game stats. 

The web app is hosted on the Streamlit Community Cloud, and you can check it out [here](https://nbarecap.streamlit.app/)! 

Check it out!

## Data sources
___

The Streamlit web app pulls data from two main sources based on the selections on the app widgets.
- [Basketball Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/): per game stats are scrapped directly from Basketball Reference. Meanwhile, the awards winners data is a  static table pulled from Basketball Reference, given that it does not need constant updates since awards are given once a year.
- [NBA API](https://github.com/swar/nba_api): the shot chart graph sends requests to the NBA API to pull the data of made and missed shots.

## How to deploy the web app locally
___

Bellow, I am leaving a sugestion on how to run the web app locally.

```
git clone https://github.com/ribeiroluan/streamlit-nba-recap

# change to project repository
cd streamlit-nba-recap

# install requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt

# use streamlit to run the app
streamlit run app.py
```
